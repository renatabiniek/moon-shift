## Deployment
---
### Deploying to GitHub Pages

The project was developed in GitPod, committed to Git and pushed to GitHub. 
The site was deployed to GitHub Pages with the following steps:

1. Login to GitHub
2. Navigate to your site's repository, which for this project is XXX
3. At the top of the repository, locate and click **Settings** 
4. In the left-hand side panel, click **Pages**
5. Under **Source**, click the dropdown called *None* and select *Branch: Master* and *Root* folder
6. Click **Save**
7. A notification message will show up that the page is getting ready to be published
8. Once refreshed, the message will change to *Your site is published* and a link to the deployed site will be provided: 

    The live site can be found here: (#)

    ![Published Site](#)

The process can also be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site).  

### Forking to GitHub Repository

You can create a fork (copy) of the repository. This allows you to experiment with the code without affecting the original project.

To fork the repository:

1. Log in to your [GitHub](https://github.com/) account 
2. On GitHub, navigate to the repository you want to fork
3. In the top right corner of the page, underneath your profile avatar, click **Fork**
4. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account

### Making a local clone

You can clone your repository to create a local copy on your computer. Any changes made to the local copy will not affect the original project. To clone the **XXX** project, follow the steps below:

1. Log in to your [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and locate the [XXX repository](#)
2. In the repository, click on **Code** button located above all the project files
3. Under HTTPS, copy the link generated (#)
4. Open the terminal you're using, e.g. Gitpod
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory created
6. Type ```git clone``` and then paste the URL you copied earlier:  
```git clone #``` 
7. Press **Enter** to create your local clone.

You can also refer to this [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository) for detailed instructions.
